For installation on a Debian-like system:

You will need:
- Python 2.7.x
- The python-twisted package

That should be it!

If you want to use pip packages, e.g. installing into
a virtualenv, then you'll need:
- pip
- A compiler that pip can use
- libcrypt-dev libffi-dev openssl-dev python2-dev

Install the following pip packages:
    cryptography pyasn1 twisted


All done!
