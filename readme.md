This is an experimental [TinyMUCK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyMUCK)-like server.

One of the interesting features of this software is that it can be accessed using any SSH client, as well as a dedicated MUCK client such as tinyfugue or BeipMU.

At the moment, documentation is sparse. You can [view the incomplete Markdown docs](http://terrorbite.viewdocs.io/textgame/), or you can read [the text file where I scribble down notes and ideas](textgame.txt).
