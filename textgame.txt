Things that a text adventure world needs:

TABLES (and their columns)

    users: username, password, salt, obj, email
    objects: id, name, type, flags, desc, link, parent, owner
    deleted: id
    inventory: parent, child
    locks: obj, lock
    acl: obj, player, flags
    messages: obj, succ, fail, osucc, ofail
    objdata: obj, props, script

INITIAL OBJECTS
    When the database is created, it is populated with two initial objects, as follows:
    - The Universe (Room #0)
        This is the root of the database; without it, there would be no place for any other objects to exist in.
        - The parent of Room #0 is itself.
        - Room #0 is owned by God (#1).
    - God (Player #1)
        This is the superuser account, allowing the server admin to log in and begin creating more objects.
        - God's parent is initially #0, (there is nowhere else for it to be).
        - Like all players, #1 is owned by itself.
    Because of the importance of these two objects, the system will not allow them to be deleted, and certain flags will be enforced.
    For example, player #1 will not be able to remove the Admin flag, and if it is found to be missing at server startup, it will be re-added.

TABLE DETAILS

users table:
    Stores information about user accounts.
    This is basically just a username and password pair that then links to the id of the player's object.

objects table:
    Stores basic data about an object. This is the most important table in the database.

    - id: The database ID of the object. This is a unique, non-null unsigned integer.
    - name: A name for this object (String).
        - Names do not need to be unique, with one exception: no object may be given the same name as a Player, to prevent impersonation.
    - type: A type value (Player, Room, Action, Item, Script). This is set at creation and cannot be modified.
    - flags: A set of boolean flags that modify the object (long integer).
        - Flags have varying meaning depending on object type. Flags are listed elsewhere.
    - desc: A description (String).
        - Describes the object, and is seen when a player looks at the object.
    - link: The ID of an object that this object links to. May be null.
        - Setting the link of a Player, Item or Script to a valid container sets the object's home. These cannot be unlinked.
        - Setting the link of an Action determines either a script to execute or a room to transport the player to.
        - Setting the link of a Room currently has no effect.
    - parent: The ID of the object that contains this object, i.e. the location of the object. Cannot be null.
        - Cannot be explicitly set, but is set implicitly by moving the object.
    - owner: An owner (ID), must be a Player's ID. Players always own themselves.

deleted table:
    Contains a list of IDs whose objects have been marked as deleted.
    When a user requests deletion of an object, it is flagged as deleted, and its ID is added to this table. This gives users a chance to undo.
    When a new object is created, the first ID in this table (if any) is removed and claimed as the ID of the new object.
    The details of the deleted object with that ID are then overwritten with those of the new object, and the old object is lost forever.
    This system allows IDs to be reused and doesn't leave "holes" in the database.

inventory table:
    Stores which objects contain which other objects. This is a many-to-one relationship table.
    This is basically just a fast lookup table to quickly get a list of objects contained by another.
    The "parent" field of the objects table is authorative, and if needed, the inventory table can be entirely rebuilt from the objects table.
    
    Every object must have a parent, and cannot have multiple parents, but can contain multiple child objects.
    All objects must be able to trace their "ancestry" back to ID 0, forming a tree structure rooted at Room #0, whose parent is itself.
    The ancestry constraint sensibly prevents an object from ever containing itself, its parent, or one of its ancestors.

    Certain types of object are limited in what they can contain:
    - Rooms: May contain any type, including other Rooms.
    - Players: May contain Items, Scripts, Actions and even other Players, but not Rooms.
    - Items: May contain other Items, Scripts, and Actions, but not Rooms or Players.
    - Scripts: Identical to Items.
    - Actions: Cannot contain anything.

    Fields:
    - parent: The ID of the containing object.
    - child: The ID of an object contained by parent.


messages table: Contains the values for the various messages that an object may have.
    This will generally only contain rows for Actions and Items.
    All values are varchars, and all may be null, in which case no message is displayed.
    
    Fields:
    - succ: A success message.
        - For Actions, a player will see this message when they successfully invoke the Action.
        - For Items, a player will see this message when they pick up the item.
    - fail: A failure message.
        - For Actions, a player will see this message when they fail the Action's lock, or the script invoked by the Action returns failure.
        - For Items, a player will see this message when they fail to pick up an item.
    - osucc: An external success message, which others nearby will see.
        - The message will be automatically prepended by the player's name.
        - For Actions, players in the same room will see this message when a player successfully uses the Action.
        - For Actions linked to a room (Exits), replaces the standard "X has left" message when a player uses the exit.
        - For Items, players in the same room will see this message when a player successfully picks up the item.
    - ofail: An external failure message, which others nearby will see.
        - The message will be automatically prepended by the player's name.
        - For actions, this message is seen by others in the same room when a player fails the action's lock, or a linked script fails.
        - For Items, this message is seen seen by other players in the room when a player fails to pick up the item.
    - drop: Similar to success value.
        - The message will be automatically prepended by the player's name.
        - For Exits, this message is broadcast to all players in the destination room, replacing the standard "X has arrived" message.
        - For Items, this message is seen by other players in the room where a player drops this item.
    - There is no "drop fail" message.
    
locks table:
    This is a many-to-many relationship table, holding the individual values from an object's basic lock list.
    
acl table:
    This is a many-to-many relationship table, holding the individual values from an object's access control list.
    Each entry has associated flags that specify what level of access that player has to this object.

    - acl: An access list, basically a list of player IDs with permission to modify this object. Access lists are inherited from the parent.
    - props: Properties, which is an arbitrary dictionary of string key/value pairs, whose values may themselves be a dictionary.

FLAGS
    G: God
        - Script: allows it to use all functions without restriction. Warning! This basically lets a script run "as root".
        - Player: makes that Player a God (Superadmin). This lets them stop the server, so be careful!
    A: admin
        - Script: allows it to use admin functions. Warning! This lets the script do powerful things.
        - Player: makes that Player an admin.
    M: moderator
    H: helper
    
    e: ENVIRONMENT
        - Room: Marks this room as an Environment room. It becomes the default parent for any new Rooms created by a player standing in it or any non-Environment child rooms.
    p: PUBLIC
        - Room: Any user may now use this Room as a parent room. By default, only the owner of a room can use it as a parent.
        - Action: If this Action is in a user's inventory, then anyone in the same room can use the Action (safe?).
            Note that actions made Public in this way will not override existing ones; they are used only if no other exists.
            These type of Actions can only run scripts, they cannot transport the invoking player anywhere.
    l: LINKABLE (public)
        - Room: allows any player to set their home here, overriding the lock.
        - Script: allows actions to be publically linked to the script, overriding the lock.
    i: INVISIBLE
        - Item, Script, Action or Player: hides the item from the respective list (item's owner can still see it).
        - Room: makes that room "dark", meaning that a Player cannot see any other Players or Items in the room (but can still hear them, unless Silent is also set).
    s: SILENT
        - Item, Player: will cause messages to be suppressed when it enters or leaves a room, allowing movement without being noticed.
        - On a Room, will cause silence within the room by preventing players from speaking and performing actions. 
    x: XLOCK
        When checking the lock list, ALL of the locks must be passed instead of just one.
    u: LOCKED
        The result of checking the lock list is inverted, so that players will pass the lock UNLESS they match it.
    t: TRANSPARENT
        - Room: causes messages from the parent room to be shown in this room, while messages in this room are broadcast into the parent room.
    w: WARPABLE
        - Room: Players and objects may warp (teleport) into this room.
        - Item: Players and objects may warp to the same room as this item, only if the room is also warpable (?)
    
LOCKS
    Locks are checked for different reasons depending on object type:
        - Action: The lock list is checked when the user tries to trigger the action.
        - Script: The lock list is checked when a user tries to link an action to this script.
        - Room: The lock list is checked when a user tries to drop an item in this room.
        - Player: The lock list is checked when another player tries to pick up and carry this player.
        - Item: The lock list is checked when a player tries to pick up this item.
    
    The lock list is made up of a list of IDs. When the lock is checked, each ID in the list is first resolved to a boolean value as follows:
        - Player ID: true only if it matches the ID of the player who triggered the lock check.
        - Item ID: true if the inventory of the triggering player contains an object with this ID.
        - Script ID: the script is executed, and gives true if the script returns success, or false on failure.
        - Room and Action IDs are invalid, and will always resolve to false.
    
    The resulting list of boolean values is then treated as follows:
        - An empty list always results in false.
        - If the list is not empty, the result is true if any one value is true (Logical OR).
        - If the XLOCK flag is set, then all values must be true in order to give a true result (Logical AND).
        - If LOCKED is set, then the triggering player will fail the lock if the result is false.
        - Otherwise, the result is inverted, and the triggering player will fail the lock if the result is true.

    The default for a new object is an empty list and no LOCKED flag, which means all lock checks will pass.
    Setting the LOCKED flag will cause everyone to fail the lock. Subsequently adding a player's ID to the lock list will allow only them to use the object. This is fairly intuitive.
    However adding a player's ID to the list WITHOUT setting the LOCKED flag will allow everyone EXCEPT the user in the list to use the object, that is, it locks that player out.
     
    Note: The object's owner does not automatically pass if the object is locked - they must be explicitly allowed in the list.

NEW ITEMS
    Newly-created items are treated as follows:

    New Players:
        Obviously only created upon a new user registering. The Player object will be created in the server's configured room for newbies.
        By default, players are locked to themselves.
    New Items, Scripts and Actions:
        Will be created in the inventory of the creating player.
    New Rooms:
        The room containing the player is checked for the Environment (+e) flag. If it lacks this flag, then the room's parent is checked, and so on, until a room with the Environment flag is found (room #0 always has this flag). The new room will then be created as a parent of this room.

SCRIPTS
    - A script is executed by making it the destination of an action. The script is run when the action is triggered.
    - Like Items, the Destination field of a script sets its home.
    - Scripts may not be directly executed - they must be run by an Action.
    - Scripts can contain Actions, which if linked to the Script, makes them usable as a standalone item.
    - By default an Action with a Script destination will succeed. However, Scripts may explicitly return failure, which causes the Action that called it to fail. The Action will also fail if a script contains errors.
    - The success value holds the executable text of the script itself.
    - The failure value and external values are unused at the current time.
    - A script may access its own properties as a kind of persistant global storage. Generally though, such storage would be done on the Action that calls it.
    - The lock value controls who may link an Action to the script. Anyone may link to an unlocked script.

ACTIONS
    - Actions can be invoked by a player and usually have some affect on the object referred to by the action's destination field.
    - A Room destination will transport a player to that room, a Script destination will execute that script.
    - An action cannot be linked to an Object, Player or Item.
    - An action 
    - The action's Lock field determines who can successfully use/run the action.
    - Actions cannot contain anything, they do not have an inventory.
    - Visibility rules:
        - When contained by a Room, or an Item/Script in a Room the action is usable by any Player in that room.
        - When contained by a Player, or an Item/Script carried by a Player, only that Player can use the action.
    

ROOMS
    

A note on contents:

Players INTERACT. Rooms CONTAIN. Actions TRANSPORT. Items EXIST. Scripts MODIFY.




Players can be connected to, can perform actions, and can move between rooms.
